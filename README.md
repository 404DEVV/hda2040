# What even is this?

HDA2040 is a project aiming to allow an RP2040 to talk to audio codecs using the Intel HDA (HD Audio) protocol

# Software

- current state: like 2/10
- core functionality (WIP)
- usb sound card functionality (planned)
- circuit/micropython library (planned)

# Hardware

## PROTO1:

- basically speedran design while drinking 7up at 1am (no, not sponsored, 7up is amazing)
- flawed
- trash
- works despite the 3 above points
- basically a test
- STM32F103 as an in circuit debugger (Blackmagic Probe based)
- RP2040 as main CPU
- 16MB flash
- ALC887 codec
- minimal
- basically every pin broken out
- janky
  
## More hardware (less janky at that) coming soon™
